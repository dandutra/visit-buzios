      <h1>ðŸ‘‹ About me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Daniel, a programmer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For 7 years I
        worked as a ship pilot, a job<br />
        that while straightforward, was far from ordinary. It taught me the
        value of responsibility and<br />
        professionalism, as I was accountable for the safety of 20 people and a
        multi-million dollar<br />
        ship. Yet, because I worked on 28 x 28 days schedules (28 days onboard
        and 28 days onshore), I<br />
        started to miss too much those days I wasn't around, so I started to
        look into options.

      <p>
        During my time as a ship pilot, I started writing simple scripts and
        automating tasks, and this<br />
        small glimpse was enough to ignite my passion for technology. I'll try
        to not get too philosophical<br />
        here, but one thing that I could observe in my life is how I'm really
        thriving and happy when I'm<br />
        pursuing something, not when I own it. Hence, the almost infinite aspect
        of computer science is<br />
        not a problem for me, it's a feature.
