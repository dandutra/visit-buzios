          <p>
            I've been visiting Buzios for more than 20 years now. When I was a
            child, the beaches amused<br />
            me, I could spend all day long on any of them, as a teenager I
            enjoyed sometimes too much of<br />
            its night life, as an adult I've built many fond memories with my
            wife and friends. This is the<br />
            place where I'm going to retire on and in this article you'll learn
            what makes it my favorite<br />
            place on Earth.

          <p>
            The peninsula, initially named ‚Äútip of the shells‚Äù due to numerous
            gastropod shells on its<br />
            beaches, was renamed ‚ÄúArma√ß√£o dos B√∫zios‚Äù after the construction of
            Arma√ß√£o das Baleias de<br />
            B√∫zios, a commercial establishment. When the Portuguese presence
            weakened, France and<br />
            England used the main port as a naval base for piracy and trade.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the 1950s, Arma√ß√£o beach became popular for summer residences
            among Brazilian and<br />
            French bourgeoisie, but only after the french actress and pop icon
            Brigitte Bardot visit<br />
            in 1964, the village's transformation began. Bardot made public her
            love for the place,<br />
            drawing international attention and increasing its popularity,
            especially among French and<br />
            Argentine tourists and a bronze statue was built after her at the
            Bardot waterfront.

          <h2 id="get-there">üìå How to get there</h2>
          <p>
            Now this is one of the best thing about Buzios, it is located far
            enough from Rio's touristic hub<br />
            so you get away of the noise and all other alarming numbers that
            scary tourists away.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ways you can get there (as usually) depends on your budget,
            Buzios has an airport for<br />
            private flights and a busy bus terminal. A bus trip from Rio takes
            roughly 3 hours and it<br />
            costs from R$75,00 to R$173,00 (CAD 19,00 to CAD 44,00), check the
            options
            <a
              href="https://www.clickbus.com.br/onibus/rio-de-janeiro-rj/buzios-rj"
              target="_blank"
              >here</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best option in my opinion is going by car, it is faster (2:20
            hours) and you have the chance<br />
            to stop by Queij√£o, a highly rated (and inexpensive) snack
            restaurant focused on its many<br />
            proprietary cheese options or Kiosque do Alem√£o, as good as the
            former, but slightly more<br />
            expensive, it also offers more options on german cuisine. I've
            pinned them both on the map below:
          </p>

          <h2 id="stay">üõèÔ∏è Where to stay</h2>
          <p>
            Buzios has a right place for every budget, the best options are
            always the first to go away in<br />
            peak seasons. If this is your first time going there, you'll
            probably stay most of the day and<br />
            maybe all night away from your hotel, so your best course of action
            here is to pick a place near<br />
            the beaches that interests you the most, don't fall for the all
            inclusive options as there are plenty<br />
            of delicious restaurants nearby.
          </p>

          <h2 id="food">üçõ What and where to eat</h2>
          <p>
            Differently from its neighbors Cabo Frio and S√£o Pedro da Aldeia,
            Buzios has got a very nice<br />
            selection of restaurants, mainly distributed across two hubs: Rua
            das Pedras and Portinho. The<br />
            former is an icon of Buzios, just over 600 meters long, the
            ‚Äúcatwalk‚Äù is full of trendy bars,<br />
            sophisticated restaurants, designer shops, inns, cafes, art
            galleries, ice cream parlors and<br />
            nightclubs (we'll cover them soon), as first timer, don't sleep on
            Chez Michou's delicious
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cr%C3%AApe" target="_blank"
              >crepes</a
            >,<br />
            which are basically pancake's french and thinner cousins.

            This is one aspect in which Buzios really shine, if you're into
            electronic music it shines brighter<br />
            than Rio itself with prominent clubs like Privilege, a club that
            became a reference in Brazil's<br />
            scene by hosting several Tomorrowland calibre DJs like Dimitri Vegas
            & Like Mike, Carl Cox,<br />
            Camelphat, Amine Edge and many others. It is commonly referred by
            the Brazil's biggest DJs<br />
            Alok and Vintage Culture as their favorite place to play.

            I've been there many times, even for New Year's Eve parties, 24 hour
            long sets and my only<br />
            complaint about them would be the overpriced drinks, so try to start
            drinking before getting in at<br />
            one of the bars nearby and check out their

            Beach Club, Fishbone and Silk Beach Club. For all of these clubs,
            make an effort to stay up until<br />
            the sunrise, it's worth it!

          <p>
            And all of this was just a glimpse of Buzios, each time you go there
            you can experience<br />
            something new. In my opinion, it all comes down to the sheer amount
            of options that it can offer.<br />
            You can't feel the dullness of a regular coastal city there.
          </p>
